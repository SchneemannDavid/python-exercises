### Movies for the kids
##You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear 
#(for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if 
# they're going to like it). If price for a movie per day is 3 dollars, how much will you have to pay?

little_mermaid_days = 3
brother_bear_days = 5
hercules_days = 1
cost_per_day = 3
total = little_mermaid_days * cost_per_day + hercules_days * cost_per_day + hercules_days * cost_per_day
total


##Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you 
# a different rate per hour. Google pays 400 dollars per hour, Amazon 380, and Facebook 350. 
# How much will you receive in payment for this week? You worked 10 hours for Facebook, 
# 6 hours for Google and 4 hours for Amazon.

hourly_rate_google = 400

hours_worked_google = 10


# make calculations using variables
total_pay_google = hourly_rate_google * hours_worked_google
total_pay_amazon = 

total_pay = total_pay_google + 

total_pay
